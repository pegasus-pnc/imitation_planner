<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Motion planning with imitation learning in autonomous driving is challenging, because of the complexity of scenarios and the distribution difference between training data and actual driving. 
In this paper, we propose an novel imitation learning method that incorporates data augmentation and post-processing techniques. 
Our model utilizes recent advance in motion prediction, such as vectorized map representation, transformer encoder and decoder, and GMM output with predefined initial queries. 
Data augmentation is used to generate data which deviates from expert trajectories. 
In post-processing, we employ a low planning rate to mitigate error accumulation, and a collision detector to trigger timely replanning. 
Finally, our method achieved 3rd place in the CVPR 2023 Autonomous Driving Challenge - Track 4 Nuplan Planning.</p>
